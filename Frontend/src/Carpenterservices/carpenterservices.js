            </pre>
            <hr />
            <p>
              A lot of energy and time is invested in keeping a house together.
              There might be a squeaky door hinge that needs your attention or
              the vintage master bed may need some fixing. A window frame might
              need some redoing or you may want a new customized wooden shelf
              for the room. But in today’s time, it becomes a task to get these
              things done. Taking a day off is impractical while fetching a
              carpenter on Sundays is itself a task. That is why{" "}
              <b>NeedService</b> is here to provide you with the best carpenter
              services in your location at standardized prices.

                  Jammed Lock: This is the most common problem that everybody
                  encounters. Jammed lock can be fixed by coating the door key
                  with powdered graphite or spraying the graphite into the
                  keyhole. This acts as a lubricant and may unjam the lock.

                  Broken Furniture: Broken furniture can be fixed at home but
                  then again, it won’t last long. It’s better to get a carpenter
                  at home and let him fix it in the best possible way.

                  Creaking hinges: You can fix the creaking sound of your door
                  by applying some oil to the hinges. It might solve the problem
                  for a short period of time.
